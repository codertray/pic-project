                    When I lived withmy parents we lived out of town. Being visually
                    impaired i can't drive, so I found myself commuting backand
                    forth with my mom a lot. This particular morning it was just me,
                    and her, and we crossed the 10th Avenue bridge just at the
                    perfect moment. The sun was just showing it's face, and the ice
                    on the river had broken. I love moments like this. the time you
                    catch something beautiful during your day, and it brightens
                    everything. My Momis a big fan of this one too.
