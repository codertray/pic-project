                    My poor brother! we were elk hunting innorthern montana, and boy the
                    day was turning out beautiful. we took a break and went walking to
                    a small lake near the road. By small i mean real small. You could
                    see the shore all around the lake. my brother was kiond enough to
                    help medown the path because I nearly went tumbling down a hill
                    I couldn't see. When we reached the lake it was covered with ice,
                    so my brother starts taking ice from the shore, and spinning it
                    onto the lake. Suddenly i was inspired! "can you grab a big
                    sheet of ice, and hold it up for me to take a photo through?" I
                    asked. This is the result. i love how itturned out. For those
                    who may be interested I was using the Canon EOS m50 with the 15-45
                    kit lens.
