                    This one is actually my mom's favorite. It's Pretty simple. Just a
                    silhouette of a tree we had in our backyard. While I can enjoy
                    just about any photo subject, my mom loves nature. she's
                    especially fond of plants. She once told me that every tree told a
                    story. You can probably tell, but my mom, and I are really close.
